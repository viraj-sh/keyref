## About

[**keyref**](https://keyref.netlify.app) is a simple web app that collects and displays keyboard shortcut cheatsheets for different tools and platforms — all in one place.

It was built to solve a common problem: finding and managing keyboard shortcuts across multiple apps can be frustrating, especially when you just want quick access without digging through documentation or cluttered sites.

With **keyref**, you can:

- Browse and view keyboard shortcuts for a wide range of tools.
- Download cheatsheets for offline use.
- Jump directly to the practice pages on [shortcuts.foo](https://shortcuts.foo) to test your skills.
- Access all this through a clean and fast interface.

## How It Works

keyref uses the public endpoints from **shortcuts.foo** to fetch data for each tool, scrape the available shortcuts, and present them neatly on the frontend.  
Each tool page includes:

- A structured cheatsheet view.
- A direct link to practice shortcuts for that tool on **shortcuts.foo**.

## Motivation

While practicing shortcuts on **shortcuts.foo** is great, accessing the cheatsheets themselves wasn’t always convenient.  
**keyref** bridges that gap — giving you quick, centralized access to all available keyboard shortcuts without the need to practice every time.

It’s designed for anyone who:

- Loves using keyboard shortcuts to boost productivity.
- Wants an easy way to explore or download shortcuts across tools.
- Enjoys learning to be faster and more efficient at the keyboard.

## Future Plans

This is just the start.  
Future updates may include:

- Integration with new APIs or shortcut sources.
- Additional features around learning and mastering keyboard efficiency.
